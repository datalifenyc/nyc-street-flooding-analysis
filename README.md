## Installation

### Application Installs

1. Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) to manage Python packages and environments.

2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to maintain version control.

3. Install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/) to build diagrams with code.

### Terminal Commands

1. Clone [nyc-street-flood-analysis](https://github.com/datalifenyc/nyc-street-flood-analysis) repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/datalifenyc/nyc-street-flood-analysis.git
    ```

2. Enter folder directory of local repo

    ```bash
    cd nyc-street-flood-analysis
    ```

3. Install requirements

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

    Two alternative environment files are provided, in case you experience issues building the environment from the detailed build yml file.

    1. `environment_no_builds.yml`
    2. `environment_from_history.yml`

4. Activate conda environment

    ```bash
    conda activate nyc-street-flood-analysis
    ```

5. Configure Git to track large notebook files

    ```bash
    git lfs track "*.ipynb"
    ```

    Jupyter Notebooks with maps tend to larger in size. For best practices and to avoid commit warning/errors, as well as, issues pushing repo to GitHub,
    use [Git Large File Storage](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files).

    To `push` lfs updates to repo, enter:

    ```bash
    git lfs push origin main
    ```
