## Installation ðŸ’½

### Application Installs

1. Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) to manage Python packages and environments.

2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to maintain version control.

3. Install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/) to build diagrams with code.

### Terminal Commands

1. Clone [nyc-street-flood-analysis](https://github.com/datalifenyc/nyc-street-flood-analysis) repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/datalifenyc/nyc-street-flood-analysis.git
    ```

2. Enter folder directory of local repo

    ```bash
    cd nyc-street-flood-analysis
    ```

3. Install requirements

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

    Two alternative environment files are provided, which offer detailed library versions (`environment-no-builds.yml`) and build info (`environment-with-builds.yml`).

4. Activate conda environment

    ```bash
    conda activate nyc-street-flood-analysis
    ```

5. Install and Configure Git to track large notebook files

    | Step 1: [Install](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage)   | Step 2: [Configure](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/configuring-git-large-file-storage)         |
    | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
    | `git lfs install` | `git lfs track "*.ipynb"` |

    Jupyter Notebooks with maps tend to larger in size. For best practices and to avoid commit warning/errors, as well as, issues pushing repo to GitHub,
    use Git Large File Storage (Git LFS): [website](https://git-lfs.com/) | [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files) | [repo](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs).

    To `push` lfs updates to repo, enter:

    ```bash
    git lfs push origin main
    ```

## Notes

Jupyter Notebooks can be found in the [analysis-book](analysis-book/) folder.
