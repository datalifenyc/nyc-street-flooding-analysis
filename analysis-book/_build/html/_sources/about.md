## Event

[NYC Open Data Week 2023](https://www.open-data.nyc/)  

## Introduction

What secrets can we learn about NYC from 311 Street Flooding Complaints? Have you ever considered examining the relationship of NYC  311 Street Complaints dataset to other geospatial datasets?

In the talk, we attempt to answer three questions:

1. How can we measure inequality in street flooding complaints?
2. Is there a relationship between street flooding complaints and property values?
3. How does street flooding complaints compare to actual modeled flooding data?

This project stems from a prior NYC Open Data 2021 talk: [Analyzing NYC's 311 Street Flooding Complaints from 2010 to 2020](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-311-street-flooding), given by [Mark Bauer](https://github.com/mebauer). This talk is an attempt to address some of the questions that were asked during the Q&A session.
