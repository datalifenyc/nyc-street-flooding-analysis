## Description 🌦

- What secrets can we learn about NYC from 311 Street Flooding Complaints❓
- Have you ever considered examining the relationship of NYC 311 Street Complaints dataset to other geospatial datasets❓

__In this talk, we attempt to answer three questions:__

:::{grid-item-card}
_How can we __measure inequality__ in street flooding complaints?_
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
_Is there a relationship between street flooding complaints and __property values__?_
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
_How does street flooding complaints compare to __actual modeled__ flooding data?_

```{admonition} Inspiration!
:class: tip
This project stems from a prior NYC Open Data 2021 talk: [Analyzing NYC's 311 Street Flooding Complaints from 2010 to 2020](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-311-street-flooding), given by [Mark Bauer](https://github.com/mebauer). This talk is an attempt to address some of the questions that were asked during the Q&A session.
```

## Who should attend? 👩🏽‍💻

Anyone with __beginner-level__ proficiency is welcome! It is helpful, but not required to have some background knowledge in:

✔ Basics of Python or other programming languages (R, SQL, etc.)  
✔ Implementing Data Analysis techniques  
✔ Working with Jupyter Notebooks  
✔ Interest in NYC 311 Open Data or Street Flooding datasets  

## Speakers | Say Hello 👋

A group of civic minded __data enthusiasts__, who enjoy solving City related data problems together.
